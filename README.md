# Etch A Sketch

This was `Etch A Sketch`, the [*4th project*](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch) within the Odin Project curriculum. This was an assignment designed to make students utilise the Internet during errors and issues, applying fundamental skills learnt to an application project.

In Etch A Sketch, I revised my knowledge on JavaScript DOM Manipulation using event listeners and event handlers. I also practiced string concatenation to link variables from JavaScript into CSS. I learnt about data attributes and using input types in HTML too! For the styling, I also learnt about removing platform-native styles using `-webkit-appearance`.
